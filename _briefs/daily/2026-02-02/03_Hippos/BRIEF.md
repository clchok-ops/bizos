## Flags Requiring Action

### 🟡 Watch

**Owner Workload Imbalance**
- **Issue**: Atie Hashim has 80% of today's enquiries (4 of 5)
- **FY Lim**: Only 1 enquiry
- **Questions to investigate**:
  1. Is this assignment intentional (Atie is primary)?
  2. Is FY Lim unavailable?
  3. Should workload be redistributed?
- **Recommended action**: Review assignment rules in Zoho CRM
- **Escalate to**: Hippos Manager if imbalance persists > 3 days

**High Troubleshooting Ratio**
- **Issue**: 60% troubleshooting (3 of 5) vs benchmark <50%
- **Context**: Could indicate:
  - Product quality issues
  - Customer service needs
  - Or just a one-day blip
- **Recommended action**: Monitor for 3 days before flagging as issue
- **Track**: Types of troubleshooting requests (warranty? installation? usage?)
