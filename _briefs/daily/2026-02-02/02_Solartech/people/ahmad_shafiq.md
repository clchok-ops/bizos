## Performance Context

Your win rate (23%) is below the team benchmark (32%).

**This is not criticism - it's data to help you improve.**

Possible factors to review:
- Are deals being qualified properly at intake?
- Is there a specific stage where deals are getting stuck?
- Would it help to shadow a higher performer like Ted (52%) or Yati (78%)?

**Suggested conversation**: Discuss with Sales Manager what support would help.
