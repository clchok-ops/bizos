## Next Focus

**Immediate:**
- ~~Phase 0 O365 PA Agent — Chok-owned~~ ✅ Done — Azure AD app reg, Dataverse security role, n8n credential setup, PnP CLI install. Claude creates runbook.
- Resume builder work and performance management
  - ~~Install skills~~ ✅ Done — startup_v2 + builder_v3 installed, validated in perf startup
  - ~~Test new startup~~ ✅ Done — profile-aware loading working (CORE_RULES.md loaded, perf mode correct)
  - Disable Control Chrome connector — Saves ~3-5K tokens/turn from duplicate browser tools
  - Verify rules split — Check for duplicate rule across CORE/BUILD/REFERENCE split (43 total vs 42 expected)
  - ~~Delete root orphans~~ ✅ Deleted by Chok between sessions
- Phase 1 O365 PA Agent — Build WF-PA-HEALTHCHECK (validation gate), then WF-PA-DEPLOY, WF-PA-SOLUTION, WF-PA-MONITOR

**Then:** Resume builder work and performance management
- Performance management structure — Medium priority deliverable from TOKEN_EFFICIENCY_AUDIT.md Section 4.7
- Resume WF03 Solartech Pipeline Risk — Phase 2 reference implementation (originally deferred for efficiency audit)
  - Redesign WF03 for action-oriented workflow (not just alerts)
  - Two-way Telegram (alert + prepared action + inline buttons + callback)
  - Action execution (Zoho API: send email, create task, update deal stage)
- Fill in role KPI targets (Solartech roles have templates, need actual RM targets; Hippos/WCI need role definitions)

**Completed:**
- PTL 100-pt framework (bizos/00_Holding/PTL_FRAMEWORK.md)
- Role-based KPI structure for all 3 entities
- Bizos structure cleanup + STRUCTURE.md
- Structure validation in startup/end-session skills (staged)
- F-012, F-013 logged + G-DOC-005, G-SKILL-001 added

**Cleanup backlog** (fix opportunistically while working in this space):
- [x] `REVIEW_FRAMEWORK.md` at bizos root — ✅ Documented in STRUCTURE.md
- [x] `automation/` folder at bizos root — ✅ Documented in STRUCTURE.md (Special Folders)
- [ ] Hippos, WCI, Kinme roles/ — scaffolded only (_ROLES_INDEX.md). Populate when doing entity work
- [x] 00_Holding/ extra files — ✅ N8N_AUTOMATIONS, SETUP_CHECKLIST, SETUP_PLAYBOOK, thresholds.json added to STRUCTURE.md
- [ ] _INBOX pipeline has zero monitoring — was broken 7 days undetected (F-029). Add "last file received" staleness check to WF08 Watchdog. Threshold: alert if no _INBOX file in 48 hours.
- [x] `O365_PA_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` — ✅ Already correctly in cto-brain/designs/ (not orphaned)
- [x] `_skill_installers/` at ClaudeHub root — ✅ Deleted
- [x] `startup_v2.skill` + `builder_v3.skill` at ClaudeHub root — ✅ Deleted
- [ ] 1 duplicate rule across CORE/BUILD/REFERENCE split (43 total vs 42 expected) — minor, needs grep to identify

**Parked:** PTL 121 Flow 5, Kaizen Architecture Phase 1

**Agent Infrastructure:**
- Strategy: `cto-brain/designs/AGENT_STRATEGY_v2.md` (action-oriented, cross-domain learning)
- Domain goals: `bizos/AGENT_GOALS.md` (to be created), `trading/AGENT_GOALS.md`, `personal-finance/AGENT_GOALS.md`
- Builder: `cto-brain/builder/` (BUILD_LOG, CHECKLIST, RULES, specs/, artifacts/, runbooks/)
- n8n: `https://n8n-production-f0e6.up.railway.app` (Railway, Asia/Kuala_Lumpur TZ)
- Telegram: @chokops_bot — 7 domain chats (Solartech, Hippos, WCI, Kinme, Trading, Finance, System)
- Builder skill: installed in Cowork (invoke with `builder`)
- Build sequence: WF03 Solartech → WF04 Hippos → WF05 WCI → WF06 Trading → WF07 Finance → WF02 Kinme → WF08 Watchdog
