## Decision Log

> Record of decisions made and their outcomes

### 2026-02

**[2026-02-01] 360° Loop Architecture**
- **Decision**: Use existing email→iCloud routing (automation@solartech.com.my → _INBOX/) instead of complex n8n/WorkDrive setup
- **Rationale**: Simpler = more reliable. Email routing already works. Avoid over-engineering.
- **Outcome**: Configuration guide created (`02_Solartech/REPORT_CONFIGURATION.md`)
- **Action Required**: Chok to manually update Zoho report frequencies from Weekly → Daily

### 2025-01

**[2025-01-31] Architecture Decision**
- **Decision**: Adopt sustainable BizOS architecture with CONTEXT.md as persistent memory, n8n for automation, and integration with existing Zoho/Odoo systems
- **Rationale**: Static spreadsheets not sustainable; need system that learns and improves automatically without manual weekly reviews
- **Outcome**: Implemented

---

## Learnings & Patterns

> What we've learned that applies across entities

### Process Learnings
- Historical data eliminates "observation period" - can build models same day
- Backtesting on closed deals validates model before going live
- 4,209 deals → actionable risk model in <15 minutes

### Cross-Entity Patterns
- (Pending Hippos/WCI analysis for comparison)

### What Worked
- Compressed timeline: Historical data analysis vs waiting to observe
- Risk scoring with specific thresholds (not vague "at risk" labels)
- Backtest validation (92.8% accuracy) before recommending

### What Didn't Work
- Zoho MCP `get_deal_by_name` and `list_open_deals` returning API errors
- Need to troubleshoot MCP connection for write access
- Zoho CRM new UI causes browser automation timeouts (forms don't respond reliably)
- Complex n8n/WorkDrive architecture → over-engineering when email routing already exists

## Process Improvements

> Automation candidates, friction points, efficiency gains

| Date | Area | Improvement | Status | Impact |
|------|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 2026-02-01 | Data Flow | Use email routing vs complex n8n | Implemented | Simpler, reliable |
| 2026-02-01 | Reports | Change Weekly → Daily | Pending (Chok) | Faster feedback loop |
| 2026-02-01 | Format | XLS → CSV for all reports | Pending (Chok) | Easier parsing |

---

## Next Session Focus

> What to prioritize in the next working session

### Immediate
1. **Set up cto-brain auto-sync** — Clone to iCloud, configure launchd watcher (mirror bizos)
2. **Commit GROW/PTL architecture** — Once sync is live, drop `modules/grow-ptl/ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. **Design PTL data entry mechanism** — Critical gap: who enters what, how?

### Pending (Chok Config)
4. **[CHOK] Update Zoho CRM/Inventory reports to Daily** — See `02_Solartech/REPORT_CONFIGURATION.md`
5. **[CHOK] Create missing reports** — Win/Loss, Aging Deals

### Next Steps
6. **Solartech: Validate high-risk deals** — Does the flagged list match reality?
7. **Define first autonomous action** — What can Claude auto-do?

### Blocked
- Zoho MCP `list_open_deals` returning API errors — needs troubleshooting
- Eats365 API access — pending developer account request
