## Key Findings

### 1. High Discount Rate (21.7%)

**Issue**: RM 2,782.63 in discounts on RM 12,823.50 gross sales.

**Top Discount Items**:
| Item | Units | Discount | % of Price |
|------|-------|----------|------------|
| Hokkaido Kegani | 6 | RM 1,470 | 25% |
| Uni Sushi | 10 | RM 350 | 20% |
| Taraba Gani | 1 | RM 300 | 25% |

**Questions to investigate**:
- Is this a promotion day?
- Staff discounts?
- Loyalty program?
- Pricing strategy issue?

**Recommendation**: Review discount policy. Target <10%.

### 2. Food Costs Not Tracked

The POS shows RM 0 for all item costs. This means:
- No food cost % visibility
- No margin analysis possible
- Menu engineering incomplete

**Action Required**:
- Input food costs manually into CFO Toolkit
- Or set up cost tracking in Eats365

### 3. Strong Average Spend

RM 409/cover is excellent for an upmarket izakaya. This confirms:
- Premium positioning is working
- Customers are ordering high-value items
- Upselling is effective

### 4. Revenue Concentration

**Top 5 items = 77% of revenue**:
1. Hokkaido Kegani (RM 5,880) - 45%
2. Uni Sushi (RM 1,750) - 14%
3. Taraba Gani (RM 1,200) - 9%
4. Miyazaki Akagai (RM 704) - 5%
5. Botan Ebi Sashimi (RM 418) - 3%

**Risk**: Heavy reliance on premium seasonal items.
