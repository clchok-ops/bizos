## 1. DISCOUNT ANALYSIS - KEY FINDINGS

### Overall Discount Pattern
The analysis reveals **a discrepancy between item-level and daily-level discount data:**

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Daily Summary Discount Rate | 2.00% average | Low, stable discounting pattern |
| Item-Level Discount Rate | 2.41% | Slight premium at item level |
| Max Daily Discount Rate | 17.59% | Single anomaly (Jan 31) |
| Days with >20% discount | 0 | No pattern of extreme discounts |
| Days with >15% discount | 1 | One outlier |
| Days with >10% discount | 1 | Minimal high-discount days |
| Days with >5% discount | 4 | Rare |

### Critical Observation: **The 21.7% mentioned is NOT present in this data**

- **Maximum observed discount rate:** 17.59% (January 31, 2026 - Saturday)
- **No consistent 21.7% pattern found** across any day or category
- This suggests either:
  1. The 21.7% reference point is from a different reporting period
  2. It may have been an isolated historical incident
  3. Data sources may calculate discounts differently

### Discount Rate Trend Throughout Month
```
Week 1 (Jan 1-7):   0.46% average discount
Week 2 (Jan 8-14):  0.78% average discount  
Week 3 (Jan 15-21): 1.48% average discount
Week 4 (Jan 22-28): 2.16% average discount
Week 5 (Jan 29-31): 4.62% average discount ← SIGNIFICANT INCREASE
```

**Insight:** Discount usage increased substantially in the final week of the month, peaking on January 31.

### January 31 Anomaly (Final Day)
- **Discount Rate:** 17.59%
- **Discount Amount:** RM 2,782.63
- **Gross Sales:** RM 13,040.50
- **Day of Week:** Saturday (typically high volume)
- **Possible Explanations:**
  - Inventory clearance before month-end closing
  - New Year's Month-End Promotion
  - Specific item discounting (e.g., perishables, seasonal items)
  - System-wide promotional event

## 6. ITEMS WITH HIGHEST DISCOUNT RATES - INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SIGNAL

### Potential Inventory Clearance Items

| Item | Discount Rate | Units Sold | Discount Amount | Sell Price |
|------|---|---|---|---|
| Iberico Shoulder Katsu | 20.00% | 11 | RM 104.50 | RM 523.50 |
| Furofuki Daikon Niku Miso | 20.00% | 8 | RM 60.00 | RM 300.00 |
| Hokkaido Kegani | 20.00% | 6 | RM 1,470.00 | RM 7,350.00 |
| Hiramasa Sashimi | 20.00% | 4 | RM 18.00 | RM 90.00 |
| Mejina Sashimi | 20.00% | 4 | RM 18.00 | RM 90.00 |
| Iwate Oyster | 17.46% | 13 | RM 104.50 | RM 598.50 |
| Miyazaki Akagai | 15.79% | 8 | RM 132.00 | RM 834.00 |
| Ika Sashimi | 14.29% | 18 | RM 60.00 | RM 420.00 |

**Pattern Analysis:**
- **Premium sashimi items** dominate high-discount list
- **Low volume, high-value items** more likely to be discounted
- **Perishable items** (sashimi, oysters) have discount variance
- **20% discount items** are primarily seasonal/premium (January inventory clearance typical for restaurants)

**Hypothesis Validation:**
The user's observation about informal inventory discharge appears **partially supported:**
- High-value items (Hokkaido Kegani: RM 980/unit) get discounted
- Premium sashimi (perishables) show discount patterns
- But overall discount rate is low (2%), suggesting this is NOT a systematic problem
- More likely: **Strategic discounting of slow-moving premium items** rather than panic clearance

## 8. INVENTORY MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT

### Evidence FOR Informal Inventory Discharge

✅ **Weak Signal:**
- Select premium items (sashimi, seasonal) show 15-20% discounts
- Hokkaido Kegani (RM 5,880 total, 6 units) shows 20% discount
- Final week shows escalating discount trend (0.46% → 4.62%)
- January 31 has 17.59% discount rate (month-end clearance pattern)

### Evidence AGAINST Widespread Inventory Problems

❌ **Strong Signals:**
- **Overall discount rate is only 2.00%** (very low for F&B)
- **Zero items with zero sales** (all 299 items have activity)
- **No "distressed" selling pattern** across most categories
- **Oh My Don category has 0.16% discount rate** (tight pricing control)
- **Category performance is stable** week-to-week
- **Thursday maintains 0.39% discount** despite highest volume

### Conclusion on Inventory Management

**Assessment: CONTROLLED DISCOUNTING, NOT INVENTORY CRISIS**

The data does NOT support a narrative of informal/chaotic inventory discharge:
- Discounts are low and strategic
- Applied mainly to premium perishables (expected behavior)
- Category pricing is well-maintained
- Only end-of-month anomaly suggests any pressure

**Actual Pattern Identified:**
- Strategic promotional pricing on selected items
- Month-end clearance of seasonal items (January-specific)
- Premium item management (sashimi, oysters, wagyu)
- **This is NORMAL restaurant operations, not problematic inventory management**

## 9. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

1. **Investigate Thursday Phenomenon**
   - Generate RM 13,833 daily on Thursdays (25% more than average)
   - Lowest discount rate (0.39%)
   - Likely driver: Corporate bookings, group reservations, or specific promotions
   - **Action:** Analyze reservations data for Thursday patterns
   - **Potential:** Replicate Thursday strategy for weak days

2. **Stabilize Tuesday Performance**
   - Weakest day at RM 3,887 average (46% below Thursday)
   - Consider: Tuesday specials, early-bird pricing, or corporate packages
   - **Quick Test:** Run Tuesday promotion for 2 weeks, measure impact

3. **Optimize January 31 Discount Strategy**
   - 17.59% discount drove RM 13,040 in sales
   - Determined if discount rate or event-driven sales increase
   - **Action:** Replicate month-end clearance promotion with 10-15% discount (less aggressive)

### 📊 STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

4. **Category Mix Opportunity**
   - **Small Bites:** 9% of volume, only 4.7% of revenue (underpriced?)
   - **Seasonal:** 12% of revenue despite 2% of volume (price these well)
   - **Course Menu:** RM 357.77 average - consider expanding this premium offering

5. **Discount Management**
   - Current 2% discount rate is healthy for F&B
   - Maintain strict control on sashimi/premium items (4.7% discount rate)
   - No evidence of need for increased discounting
   - **Policy:** Keep non-perishable discount rate <1%, allow 5% for premium/perishables

6. **Nomihodai (Free Flow) Program**
   - Selling 153 units of base package at RM 50
   - Driving RM 7,650 in revenue
   - 810 units of "free drinks" are add-on upsells (good sign)
   - **Recommendation:** Expand this high-margin bundle

### 🔮 FORECAST & PLANNING

7. **Expected February Trajectory**
   - Post-Chinese New Year recovery expected
   - Week 1 (Feb 1-7): Potential lower trading (holiday period)
   - Week 2+ (Feb 8+): Return to Week 2-3 baseline (RM 5,800-7,700 daily)
   - **Plan staffing accordingly**

8. **Inventory Provisioning**
   - No current inventory crisis detected
   - Seasonal items (January-specific) likely won't reorder
   - Sashimi freshness management: adjust daily ordering (4.76% discount suggests some spoilage/demand mismatch)
   - **Recommendation:** Implement first-in-first-out (FIFO) tracking for sashimi items

---

## 10. DATA QUALITY & CAVEATS

### Data Limitations

1. **Discrepancy in Item vs Daily Totals:**
   - Sales By Item total: RM 442,892.80 (all items)
   - Daily Summary total: RM 217,650.90 (daily summary)
   - **Ratio: 2.03x** - Item data includes multi-items likely with "Total" row aggregates
   - Impact: Item-level analysis shows 2.41% discount, daily shows 2.00%

2. **Happy Hour / Nomihodai Items:**
   - 810 units of "Nomihodai Happy Hour Drinks" show RM 0.00 revenue
   - These are bundled/included items (not separately sold)
   - Properly classified as promotional inclusions

3. **Missing January 1 Data:**
   - January 1 (Wednesday/New Year's Day) likely closed
   - Analysis covers 30 trading days (Jan 2-31)

### Data Confidence Level

✅ **HIGH CONFIDENCE (95%+):**
- Daily revenue totals
- Customer counts
- Day-of-week patterns
- Category revenue breakdown
- Discount rates (daily level)

⚠️ **MODERATE CONFIDENCE (75-85%):**
- Item-level discount rates (due to data structure complexity)
- Individual item performance (top/bottom items are reliable)
- Inventory clearance hypothesis (supported but not definitive)

---

## CONCLUSION

Kinme's January 2026 performance shows **healthy business operation with controlled pricing** and **no evidence of distressed inventory clearing**. Key performance drivers are Thursday trading, premium categories, and bundled offerings. The anomalously high discount rate on January 31 appears to be month-end clearance strategy rather than systemic inventory problems.

**Overall Assessment: STABLE, GROWING BUSINESS**

| Metric | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| Revenue Growth | ✅ V-shaped with strong close |
| Pricing Control | ✅ Low, strategic discounts |
| Category Mix | ✅ Diverse revenue sources |
| Inventory Management | ✅ No crisis indicators |
| Day-of-Week Performance | ⚠️ Significant variance (optimize for weak days) |
| Premium Segment | ✅ Robust seasonal sales |
