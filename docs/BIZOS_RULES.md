# BizOS — Preventive Rules

*Rules generated from business operations failures and near-misses. Prevents recurring mistakes.*

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-07
**Total Rules:** 1

## How Rules Are Created

```
Failure occurs → learn bizos: [what happened]
             → FAILURE_LOG.md (post-mortem)
             → BIZOS_RULES.md (this file — preventive rule)
```

---

## Rule Format

Rules are tagged by layer and category:

| Prefix | Layer | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| R-BIZ-SYS-XXX | System | CRM config, automation pipelines, data architecture |
| R-BIZ-PROC-XXX | Process | Review cadence, entity management, reporting |
| R-BIZ-MOD-XXX | Model | KPIs, PTL scoring, performance targets |

## System Rules (R-BIZ-SYS)

### [R-BIZ-SYS-001] Zoho OAuth Scopes Are Requested at Auth Flow, Not App Registration
**Severity:** 🟡 Important
**Added:** 2026-02-11
**Origin:** Zoho Infrastructure Agent setup — Zoho API Console UX mismatch with documentation

**Rule:** When registering a Server-based Application in Zoho API Console, there is no "scope" field. The console only asks for "Allowed HTTP Request Domains." Scopes (`ZohoCRM.settings.ALL`, `ZohoCRM.modules.ALL`, etc.) are requested during the OAuth authorization flow — typically handled by the client application (e.g., n8n's credential configuration).

**Setup pattern for n8n:**
1. Zoho API Console → Register app → add n8n domain to "Allowed HTTP Request Domains"
2. n8n → Add credential → Zoho CRM OAuth2 API → paste Client ID + Secret
3. Scopes configured in n8n's credential scope field (or passed during OAuth consent)
4. Click Connect → Zoho prompts for consent with requested scopes

**Credential:** `zoho_infra_settings` in n8n (verified 2026-02-11, read access to `/crm/v8/settings/fields` confirmed)

### [R-BIZ-SYS-002] Ground API Reference Files in Verified Session Facts, Not General Knowledge
**Severity:** 🔴 Critical
**Added:** 2026-02-11
**Origin:** Failure (F-BIZ-001: hallucinated Zoho API endpoints in skill reference file)

**Rule:** When generating API reference files, endpoint documentation, or deployment matrices for skills or artifacts, always re-read the verified deployment matrix or API capability map from the session that originally tested these endpoints. Never regenerate API specifications from general knowledge — LLMs will confidently produce plausible-looking but wrong endpoints.

**Process:**
1. Before writing any API reference file, check if a previous session verified the API capabilities
2. If verified facts exist (handoff notes, _CONTEXT.md, kaizen entries), use those as the source of truth
3. For any endpoint included in a reference file, mark it as: ✅ Verified (session + date) or ⚠️ Unverified (needs testing)
4. Never ship a skill with unverified endpoints marked as verified

**Bad:** Generate `/crm/v8/settings/functions` from general knowledge (doesn't exist)
**Good:** Re-read previous session's deployment matrix → confirm Deluge functions are NOT API-deployable → mark as UI-only

**Why:** Reference files loaded by skills are trusted as authoritative. A hallucinated endpoint in a reference file becomes a persistent source of wrong information that will be re-read every time the skill runs.

## Process Rules (R-BIZ-PROC)

### [R-BIZ-PROC-001] Never Edit _CONTEXT.md Directly — Use Handoff Files
**Severity:** 🟡 Important
**Added:** 2026-02-11
**Origin:** Failure (F-BIZ-002: direct _CONTEXT.md edit during session)

**Rule:** Never edit `_CONTEXT.md` files directly during a session. All state changes (flag resolutions, snapshot updates, entity status, cleanup backlog additions) must go through a handoff file in `_SESSIONS/pending/`. The next startup reconciles the handoff into `_CONTEXT.md`.

**Even if:**
- The change seems trivial (resolving a flag)
- No parallel sessions are active right now
- The change is "obviously correct"

**Why:** `_CONTEXT.md` is shared mutable state. Direct edits bypass reconciliation, risk merge conflicts with parallel sessions, and create duplicate work (handoff still needs to capture the same changes). The handoff pattern exists specifically to serialize writes.

**Exception:** Entity files (`_ENTITY.md`) are OK to edit directly — they're per-entity with low collision risk.

## Cross-References

Rules that apply across all repos live in `cto-brain/CRITICAL_RULES.md`. Key cross-system rules relevant to bizos:

- G-DOC-001: Check ARCHITECTURE_INDEX.md before creating new docs
- G-DOC-004: Audit existing files before creating new ones
- G-DOC-005: Validate bizos structure at session start/end per STRUCTURE.md
- G-VERIFY-001: Never claim something works until end-to-end verified

- `BIZOS_PATTERNS.md` — success patterns (the positive counterpart)
- `BIZOS_KAIZEN.md` — experiments to improve
