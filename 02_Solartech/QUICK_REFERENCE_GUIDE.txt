SOLARTECH AT-RISK DEALS MODEL - QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE
================================================================================

WHAT THIS MODEL DOES:
Predicts which large deals (>RM 50K) are likely to be lost based on 6 risk signals.
Provides actionable intervention points for sales leadership.

KEY NUMBERS TO REMEMBER:
================================================================================

PORTFOLIO SNAPSHOT (216 open large deals, RM 114.8M):
├─ Low Risk (0-20 score):    130 deals    RM 94.3M    78% avg probability
├─ Medium Risk (21-50):       62 deals    RM 12.5M    45% avg probability
└─ High Risk (51-100):        24 deals     RM 8.0M    16% avg probability

CRITICAL ACTIONS THIS WEEK:
┌─ HIGH RISK: 24 deals worth RM 7.97M need VP/leadership intervention
│  - Largest deal: PD-000127 (RM 1.59M) - Olivia Hwa - 347-day stuck cycle
│  - Ahmad Shafiq: 6 deals (0% historical win rate) - reassign or coach
│  - Olivia Hwa: 8 tenders (RM 4.1M) dormant since Dec 10 - customer check-in
│
└─ MEDIUM RISK: 62 deals - manager weekly check-ins, clarify next steps

MODEL ACCURACY:
┌─ Sensitivity: 100% - catches ALL losing deals (zero false negatives)
├─ Precision: 91.7% - when flagged, 92% actually lost
└─ Accuracy: 92.8% - overall correct on historical data

RISK SIGNAL WEIGHTS (What matters most):
================================================================================

1. PROBABILITY (<25%) = +40 points ← BIGGEST RISK FACTOR
   (100% of lost deals had <25% probability at closure)

2. INACTIVITY (>90 days) = +25 points ← SECOND BIGGEST
   (Indicates deal is stalled/abandoned)

3. LONG CYCLE (>180 days) = +15 points
   (Some deals legitimately take 6+ months, but combined with low prob = danger)

4. STAGE RISK (Idle/Tender) = +10 points
   (These stages have historically poor conversion)

5. OWNER TRACK RECORD = +3 to +10 points
   (Owners with <10% win rate on large deals carry risk)

6. COMBO CHECK = +10 bonus points
   (Low probability + Long cycle = trapped deal)

SCORE INTERPRETATION:
================================================================================

Risk Score 0-20:   LOW RISK
├─ Action: Quarterly monitoring, normal follow-up
├─ Win rate: 100% on historical data
└─ Typically: High probability (75%+), recent activity, skilled owner

Risk Score 21-50:  MEDIUM RISK
├─ Action: Weekly manager check-in, clarify timeline
├─ Win rate: 18% on historical data (82% loss rate!)
└─ Typically: Mixed signals - either low prob OR stalled activity

Risk Score 51-100: HIGH RISK
├─ Action: VP/leadership escalation, urgent intervention
├─ Win rate: 0% on historical data (100% loss rate!)
└─ Typically: Low prob + stalled + long cycle + weak owner

MOST URGENT DEALS (Top 5 by risk score):
================================================================================

1. PD-2160 (RM 55.6K)          Risk Score: 75
   Owner: Ahmad Shafiq | Stage: Solution Design | Prob: 20% | Last activity: Oct 27
   ACTION: Owner has 0% win rate on large deals. Needs reassignment.

2. PD-000127 (RM 1.59M)         Risk Score: 73
   Owner: Olivia Hwa | Stage: Solution Design | Prob: 20% | Cycle: 347 days
   ACTION: LARGEST at-risk deal! 11+ months stuck in design. Escalate immediately.

3. T-2236 (RM 71.6K)            Risk Score: 65
   Owner: Sa Lee Cham | Stage: Solution Design | Prob: 20% | No activity 120d
   ACTION: Presumed lost. Confirm status or close-lost.

4-8. Five Idle deals by Ahmad Shafiq (RM 468K combined) Risk Score: 60 each
   All with 5% probability. Clarify: proceed or write off?

9-16. Eight Tender deals by Olivia Hwa (RM 4.1M) Risk Score: 58 each
   All dormant since Dec 10. Group customer follow-up needed.

WHEN TO USE THIS MODEL:
================================================================================

DAILY/WEEKLY:
- Monitor for deals moving from Medium → High risk (requires immediate action)
- Alert on new deals exceeding 30 days of inactivity
- Flag any deal with probability drop >20 points in one week

MONTHLY:
- Run model refresh on all 216 open deals
- Track which deals moved up/down risk levels
- Monitor deal owner win rates
- Identify trending risks

QUARTERLY:
- Refine model thresholds based on new closed deal data
- Analyze successful deal patterns
- Review accounts for rep reassignment
- Assess system improvements

HOW TO INTERVENE (By Risk Score):
================================================================================

FOR HIGH-RISK DEALS (51-100):
1. VP calls customer directly (within 48 hours)
2. Clarify: Is deal still active or should be closed?
3. If active: Remove obstacles (pricing? technical issues? timeline?)
4. If inactive: Close-lost with proper reason documentation
5. Consider: Transfer to higher-performing sales rep?

FOR MEDIUM-RISK DEALS (21-50):
1. Sales manager calls deal owner (this week)
2. Ask: What's blocking progress? What's needed to advance?
3. Set specific next milestone: quote? meeting? approval?
4. Schedule customer check-in if dormant >30 days
5. Escalate to VP if stuck >30 days more

FOR LOW-RISK DEALS (0-20):
1. Standard follow-up rhythm
2. Remove bottlenecks as they emerge
3. Celebrate when they close
4. Learn from winners - what made them successful?

WHO TO ASSIGN (Based on track record):
================================================================================

REASSIGN FROM (Low performance on large deals):
- Chin Horng Liew: 0% win rate (26 large deals, 0 wins)
- Ahmad Shafiq: 0% win rate (limited sample, but concerning)
- Bryan Lim: 7% win rate (1 win, 14 deals)

ASSIGN TO (High performance on large deals):
- Ted Wong: 52% win rate (13 wins, 25 deals) ← TOP PERFORMER
- Siti Noor Bahiyah: 38% win rate (5 wins, 13 deals)
- Olivia Hwa: 17% win rate (good for complex deals with support)

SUPPORT/COACHING NEEDED:
- Olivia Hwa: Large portfolio needs better triage and follow-up discipline
- Bryan Lim, Yati Omar: Isolated underperformance - case-by-case review

KEY FINDINGS FROM DATA:
================================================================================

1. LARGE DEALS ARE HARD
   - 20.9% win rate on >RM 50K deals vs 37.8% overall
   - Winners are smaller (RM 235K avg) than losers (RM 392K avg)
   - Indicates price sensitivity on bigger deals

2. LONG CYCLES ARE NORMAL (BUT NEED ACTIVITY)
   - Won deals average 153 days to close
   - Lost deals average 107 days (they give up mid-way)
   - Pattern: Deals stall for 3-4 months, then either recover or die

3. PROBABILITY IS THE BEST PREDICTOR
   - Perfect separation between won (100%) and lost (0%)
   - Use as leading indicator on open deals
   - 58 deals currently have <25% probability = warning signs

4. DEAL OWNER SKILL MATTERS
   - 52% win rate performer vs 0% performer on same deal types
   - Suggests training gap or assignment/capability issue
   - Strong performers should mentor struggling ones

5. LOST DEALS ARE POORLY DOCUMENTED
   - 62% of loss reasons are vague or unspecified
   - Prevents learning from losses
   - Recommend: Implement mandatory close-loop feedback

QUICK CALC: SCORE A DEAL IN 30 SECONDS
================================================================================

Points   Condition
+40      Probability < 25%
+25      Days since activity > 90
+15      Sales cycle > 180 days
+10      Stage is Idle or Tender
+10      Owner has <10% win rate
+10      (Bonus) If prob <50% AND cycle >100 days
---
??       TOTAL SCORE

Example:
  Deal: 20% prob, 60 days inactive, 120-day cycle, Solution Design, Olivia Hwa
  Score: +20 (prob) + 15 (activity) + 5 (cycle) + 0 (stage) + 3 (owner) = 43
  Result: MEDIUM RISK - needs manager check-in
